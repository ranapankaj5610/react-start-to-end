# Password Generator

This is a basic Password Generator project in which we are randomly generating the password by using numbers, special characters and alphabates as per our requirement. Numbers and special characters are optional we can use them as per our choice.
We are using the hooks like:- useState, useEffect, useCallback to make our project more optimized.
We had added a copy button, which is used for copy the generated password to the clipboard.

Clone the project:-

1. Go to the project directory
2. run "npm install"
3. run "npm run dev"
